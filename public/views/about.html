            <p class="content"><span class="born">Born and raised</span> in Southern California, I had the privilege of an active upbringing snowboarding, skateboarding and playing music in sunny Orange County. In my teens when my father gave me my first guitar, music quickly became a large part of my life which eventually led to earning a Bachelors degree in music from the California State University of Fullerton. I found that achieving a musical degree satisfied both my artistic nature as well as my technical mind. While I am very drawn to creativity and artistry of all sorts, I am also very much left brained which drew me to the technical aspects of music and launching my career as an Audio Engineer.
            I was fortunate to have had many successful years owning and operating my own business, recording and mixing music for bands and artists from around the world. However, after years of being kept away from my family due to traveling and many, many long nights in the studio, I decided it would be best if I considered moving into a different line of work entirely. My first Web development experience was building my own company website and learning how to utilize the technology that the web had to offer.  This lead me to taking online web development courses, and eventually a fulltime Full Stack development program to enhance my skills on a deeper level. Now, with my education complete complete, and my experience more substantial, I am enthusiastically looking to utilize my technical skills and creativity in order to lay down roots and grow with a great company. I am currently interested in joining a great team as a front end web developer focusing on beautiful design and user experience.  I am also interested in projects ranging from personal websites to small business sites.
